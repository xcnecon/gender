Research questions:
1) What is the current state of gender inequality in China&#39;s labor market?
I am interested in examining the gender gap across various dimensions of paid work in China. This
study will explore differences in work time, including the number of months worked per year and
hours per day, as well as disparities in employment status, such as being an employee, self-
employed, an employer, or a domestic helper. Additionally, I will investigate how gender influences
the choice of industry and work type, the commuting distance from home to the workplace, and the
type of work contracts held. The research will also analyze gender pay differentials, participation in
the gig economy (including platforms like ridesharing, delivery services, and e-commerce),
retirement income, and the share of migrant workers in urban areas.
Gender inequality in the gig economy is a topic of special interest to me as this data is only
available for 2018, and the gig economy is very popular in these years. Few studies have been done
on the 2018 data, which was released in 2021.

2) How does gender inequality in China intersect with the urban-rural and east-west divide?
I aim to investigate how gender income inequality in China intersects with broader structural
divides, particularly the urban-rural divide shaped by the Hukou system and the development gap
between the coastal east and inland west. This research will examine whether and how these
regional inequalities exacerbate or mitigate gender disparities in income.

3) How does marriage status affect women’s wage income in China?
I would study how marriage status affects women’s wage and gender income inequality. For
example, I would use the age of first marriage as a control to study how women’s choice of when to
marry affects their later income.

4) How does gender inequality change after China joined WTO?
I hope to study the change in gender income inequality in China after It joined the WTO in 2001.
This task might be limited by the compatibility of data across time, but if time and data allow, I
would do it.

Theoretical framework:
The study would fit in with the context of our week 5 lecture, gender inequality in the labor market.
I would also incorporate the capability approach in the analysis of empirical findings. For example,
if early marriage has a cumulative negative effect on women’s earnings but not men’s, then I could
argue that women’s capability of earning as much as men is tampered by their capability to marry
early.
Data:
I will use the Chinese Household Income Project data (CHIP). I already possess the data set in .dta
form. I have the data from 1988 to 2018 with gaps between available years. For each year, the
survey is divided into urban and rural households. All the variables I have mentioned in the
research questions are available in the surveys, at least in the 2018 survey, which I have studied
carefully.

Methodology:
1) Summary statistics and graphs
I will present the state of gender inequality in the labor market using standard summary statistics. If
I have the ability to study it over multiple years, I would present it in a longitudinal form.
3) Inequality decomposition
I can calculate the Gini or Theil index for men and women separately alongside comparing the
mean-median income between men and women to see the within-sex and between-sex inequality in
China. It is interesting as I don’t know which sex has a higher earnings inequality. I can also
decompose the Theil index for both sexes into within and between-sex contributions to see how
much earnings inequality comes from the inequality between men and women.
3) Regression analysis
I would regress income by controlling variables such as sex, age, marital status, the age of first
marriage, hukou status, province location, and their

Teacher response:
1. May be have a broader umbrella question within which you can support the hypothesis by presenting evidence from each of the questions you have in the proposal.
2. Consider using Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess the sources of earnings inequality between men and women. 

3. It will be good to talk about a theory or some alternate theories in the paper that can explain the inequality say-
3.1 Comparative Advantage 
3.2 Labor market discrimination theories
3.3 SPA - you can talk here about unpaid work and how that has a role to play in the labor market. 
3.4 Capabilities Approach - as you also mention
