# Introduction
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001 marked a pivotal moment, accelerating its integration into the global economy and fueling a period of unprecedented export growth. This dramatic economic transformation reshaped industries, labor markets, and societal structures across the nation. While the macroeconomic benefits of this integration are widely studied, the specific impacts on gender inequality dynamics remain complex and multifaceted. This literature survey aims to synthesize existing research examining how the post-WTO era of export-led growth has influenced key dimensions of gender inequality in China. Specifically, it will review the literature concerning changes in women's labor force participation, the gender wage gap, the burden of unpaid care work, and broader issues related to women's capabilities and empowerment. By analyzing studies that explore the mechanisms linking trade expansion to gendered outcomes, this survey seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the documented effects, ongoing debates, and remaining questions surrounding the intersection of globalization and gender equality in contemporary China.
