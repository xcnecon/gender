1. Globalization and Gender Wage Inequality in China (2013)

In “Globalization and Gender Wage Inequality in China,” the authors use a comprehensive 2004 enterprise census to examine the link between foreign direct investment, export orientation, and gender disparities in Chinese manufacturing. They find that while foreign and exporting firms employ more women and exhibit higher raw wage gaps, most of those gaps stem from differences in productivity or job tasks rather than pure discrimination. In contrast, private nonexporting firms display significant wage discrimination against women that cannot be attributed solely to productivity factors. Overall, the study highlights how globalization fosters female employment and can reduce discriminatory practices through competition, yet persistent task segregation limits the potential for fully closing the gender gap. This directly informs your essay on post-reform China by illustrating how WTO-driven export growth and foreign participation both enhance women’s labor opportunities and shape ongoing wage inequities.

2. Unequal Care, Unequal Work: Toward a more Comprehensive Understanding of Gender Inequality in Post-Reform Urban China (2017)

This paper draws on Chinese feminist theory to explain how and why women in post-reform urban China shoulder greater disadvantages both in the labor market and the private family sphere. Early socialist policies had emphasized women’s public labor participation through state-run work units (danwei), yet never fully eradicated household patriarchy. With market reforms, the state withdrew many social services and welfare supports, transferring caregiving and domestic tasks predominantly back onto women. At the same time, official Marxist “gender equality” discourse faded, giving way to resurgent Confucian patriarchal norms and market-driven thinking that prizes efficiency over egalitarianism.

In labor markets, the authors highlight growing gender wage gaps, discrimination against women as “less efficient,” and severe occupational segregation—patterns amplified when state-owned enterprises were restructured in the 1990s. Women laid off from SOEs often found themselves in informal or low-status work with few benefits. The motherhood penalty worsened this disparity, as employers became increasingly wary of women’s potential reproductive responsibilities. Meanwhile, domestic demands soared: with public childcare facilities closing or privatizing, working mothers faced intensifying family-work conflicts. Many couples even accepted an unequal division of housework as “natural” or “traditional,” reflecting an alliance of Confucian patriarchal ideas and neoliberal “choice” rhetoric.

Overall, by charting how the state’s withdrawal of labor protections and services under market reforms interacted with a revival of patriarchal ideology, the authors illustrate why women’s post-reform burdens at home and at work have intensified. Their findings inform your essay by showing that China’s transition to a market economy is central to rising gender disparities—particularly when the structural “safety net” of the socialist danwei system and its egalitarian commitments vanished, leaving women with substantially more unpaid care work and weaker positions in the labor market.

3. Pragmatic Discourse and Gender Inequality in China (2013)

In this article, Xin He and Kawi Ng examine how a new “pragmatic discourse” in Chinese divorce courts shapes gender inequality. Traditionally, under Maoist policies, courts tried to preserve marriages through moral education and might deny a husband’s repeated divorce requests. Now, judges assume if one spouse (often the husband) insists on divorce, it is “inevitable,” so the court’s role becomes simply brokering a settlement. In effect, judges encourage the weaker spouse (commonly the wife) to negotiate a one-time payment and “move on,” rather than deeply investigating fault or protecting her ongoing needs.

This shift aims to give some compensation to wives, but in practice it often reinforces their disadvantaged status. Husbands aren’t held accountable for exploitative behavior—like divorcing a wife who has done most childcare or can’t produce a son—and judges disregard wives’ pleas for moral redress. By treating both spouses as equally able to walk away, the court fails to address the social and economic vulnerabilities many wives face, including lack of legal counsel or limited resources. Although judges’ “pragmatic” outlook can quickly finalize cases, it overlooks broader power imbalances, leaving divorced wives with insufficient support – and perpetuating systemic gender inequality in the family sphere.

4. Family Sources of Educational Gender Inequality in Rural China: A Critical Assessment (2009)

In “Family Sources of Educational Gender Inequality in Rural China: A Critical Assessment” (2009), Hannum, Kong, and Zhang use survey data from roughly 2,000 9–12-year-old children and follow-up information seven years later, along with two in-depth family case studies, to examine gender gaps in education in rural Gansu Province. Contrary to stereotypes of widespread discrimination, they find that most mothers express egalitarian views on girls’ capabilities and rights, and that girls often receive educational expenditures and parental homework support comparable to boys. In fact, girls typically match or exceed boys’ academic performance. Nevertheless, the authors uncover persistent traditional expectations—most parents assume sons will provide old-age support, and roughly one in five mothers agrees that “sending girls to school is useless since they will get married and leave home.” Although these beliefs do not translate into major differences in direct educational investment, they help explain why girls remain more likely to do regular chores and have slightly lower maternal aspirations. Ultimately, boys do finish with marginally higher attainment (about one-third of a year more), but the study suggests that this gap is modest. Taken together, the findings portray a more nuanced picture of gender inequality: while traditional attitudes about sons’ long-term value persist, they coexist with relatively egalitarian approaches to girls’ education, resulting in small but real attainment disparities.

5. Attitude toward Gender Inequality in China (2024)

This study, drawing on multiple years of Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) and East Asian Social Survey (EASS) data, examines how individual characteristics shape attitudes toward women’s and men’s roles in the family and workforce. Across five questions probing whether women should focus on household chores, whether they are less capable, whether their careers matter less than marriage, whether they should be laid off first, and whether spouses should share housework equally, the authors find modest overall improvements in favor of equality over time—particularly in seeing women as contributors to the paid workforce. However, traditional expectations about women’s domestic duties remain stubbornly high, and job security for women is not firmly supported. Education emerges as the most powerful determinant of more egalitarian beliefs: less-educated individuals are much more inclined to favor men over women, while higher-educated respondents exhibit lower bias. Moreover, in married couples, when a wife is more educated than her husband, respondents express more supportive views toward women’s equality. Urban residents generally show less bias than rural ones; about half of that gap is explained by differences in education. Finally, the persistence of patrilineal views—such as the idea that one must always obey the father’s authority or that the eldest son should inherit more—also correlates strongly with attitudes supporting gender inequality. Taken together, these findings indicate that policies improving educational access for women and rural areas, along with challenging patrilineal traditions, hold substantial promise for reducing gender inequality in China.

6. Gender Inequality and Social Structure in Urban China (1994)

In this piece, Norman Stockman examines how China’s urban “work-unit” (danwei) system has shaped gender inequality differently than in the capitalist West. Historically, production and reproduction in China were intertwined within large family households or early industrial enterprises that sometimes provided on-site housing and services. Under the communist regime, urban work-units became multifaceted organizations integrating labor, welfare, political activities, and living needs—far beyond the narrower “employer” role typical of capitalist firms. Through features like lifetime membership, subsidized childcare, housing, and family benefits, women were pulled into nearly universal, full-time paid employment. This tight overlap of production and reproduction, Stockman argues, helped raise women’s labor force participation, reduce wage gaps, and weaken some barriers tied to traditional domestic roles. Nonetheless, inequalities persisted, including occupational segregation and limited promotion opportunities. With economic reforms post-1978 stressing efficiency and cost-cutting, many danwei began shedding their “household-like” functions and viewing labor more as a market expense. Stockman contends that such changes—shifting childcare and domestic burdens back to private families—risk reversing gains in gender equality, as employers adopt more profit-driven approaches akin to capitalist firms where production and reproduction are strictly separated, typically to women’s disadvantage.


7. Gender Inequality in Education in China: A Meta-Regression Analysis (2014)

In this paper, Junxia Zeng, Xiaopeng Pang, Linxiu Zhang, Alexis Medina, and Scott Rozelle conduct a meta-regression analysis using data from 167 studies to evaluate trends and dimensions of gender inequality in educational attainment in China from the 1980s to the 2000s. They find clear evidence of a declining overall trend of gender inequality against girls over these decades, though significant disparities still remain, particularly in rural areas and at higher levels of education beyond compulsory schooling. Specifically, gender gaps are nearly absent within the compulsory education system (elementary and lower secondary education), yet girls still face significant disadvantages in attending upper secondary and tertiary institutions. Additionally, the study identifies that gender inequality is markedly more severe in rural regions compared to urban areas, though this rural-urban gap has narrowed over time. Minority populations show higher, though statistically less certain, levels of educational gender inequality compared to Han populations. The authors conclude that despite substantial improvement—driven largely by economic growth, market reforms, and government education policies—girls from rural areas, minorities, and those seeking education beyond compulsory levels still confront considerable barriers to educational attainment. This analysis is particularly useful for your essay by providing empirical support on how China's economic transformation and policy reforms have affected gender inequality differently across urban-rural divides and educational stages.

8. Gender Inequality in Urban China: Education and Employment (1992)

In this comprehensive empirical study, Bauer, Wang, Riley, and Zhao analyze gender disparities in education and employment within urban China using data from the 1987 One Percent Population Survey. They find significant improvements in female educational participation and labor force involvement since the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949, attributable to deliberate state interventions promoting women's entry into paid employment. However, despite these gains, gender inequality remains substantial. Women continue to lag behind men in higher educational attainment and face considerable occupational segregation. While many urban women participate in the workforce, they are disproportionately represented in low-status and lower-paid occupations, such as textiles, apparel, and service industries, and are significantly underrepresented in higher-status positions, including managerial roles and leadership in government and Party organizations. Moreover, the authors find that even after controlling for education and seniority, women remain disadvantaged in occupational advancement compared to men, highlighting entrenched gender stratification in the labor market. They argue that increased female participation alone is insufficient for achieving gender equality unless accompanied by broader changes in societal attitudes and structural practices, including equitable division of household labor and caregiving responsibilities.

9. Women's Health Status and Gender Inequality in China (1997)

This article by Mei-yu Yu and Rosemary Sarri provides a historical review of the health status of Chinese women from the 1950s through the early 1990s, focusing on infant, child, maternal, and elderly health indicators. They show substantial improvements in women’s health over this period, including dramatic reductions in maternal and infant mortality rates and significant increases in female life expectancy. However, despite these advances, gender inequality in health remains significant, particularly due to deeply ingrained cultural practices such as son preference, resulting in higher mortality for female infants and children. Rural women experience markedly poorer health outcomes compared to their urban counterparts, largely due to uneven access to healthcare services and resources. The authors also highlight emerging health issues in the reform era, such as increased female suicide rates—particularly among young rural women—driven by socioeconomic pressures and ongoing gender-based discrimination. They argue that addressing these health disparities will require broader policy interventions aimed at improving women's socioeconomic conditions, expanding healthcare coverage, providing targeted maternal and mental health services, and challenging persistent cultural biases. This comprehensive analysis contributes to your essay by emphasizing the connection between structural reforms, gendered cultural norms, and health inequalities faced by Chinese women during China's post-reform transition period.
