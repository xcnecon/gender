1. Introduction
* 1.1. Hook: Significance of China's WTO accession (Dec 2001) and subsequent economic transformation.
* 1.2. Background: Briefly state the rapid export growth observed post-WTO and the concurrent focus on gender dynamics.
* 1.3. Define Key Concepts: High export growth (post-WTO phenomenon), specific dimensions of gender inequality (LFPR, wage gap, unpaid care, capability approach).
* 1.4. Research Question/Objective: Clearly state the survey aims to review literature on how China's post-WTO high export growth period affected these dimensions of gender inequality.
* 1.5. Scope and Limitations: Define temporal scope (primarily post-2001, using pre-accession gender situation as baseline) and other limitations.
* 1.6. Theoretical Framework(s): Briefly mention relevant theories connecting trade expansion/economic shocks to gender outcomes.
* 1.7. Outline Structure: Briefly map out the survey sections.
